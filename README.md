# Answerly - Team J
- *docs* repository is our website file. 
- Our working slice is in *devel* branch.

For testing our website :

We are using MEAN stack. Our database is being hosted on mLab.com.
Install NodeJS and dependencies for express.

Clone the repo from devel. 

From the command prompt, move to the folder Answerly folder.
Run the command "node app" on the prompt. The output should be "Running on port 3000...".

Open a browser and type "localhost:3000" and press enter. The website will be displayed.

NOTE: we are currently trying to host the website on heroku.
